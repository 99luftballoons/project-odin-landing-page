# project-odin-landing-page
This is the Landing PAge project for Project Odin's Foundation course. The goal is to do a landing page as close as possible to the one at https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png.
The goal was to use Flexbox and several techniques learned through the course. I have decided to stick to it and did it all in Flexbox.
My formatting is close - but not exact- to the one proposed.
I made minor changes to the design.
For the landing page, I decied to use Vandelay Industries. Seifield fans will recognize the name. For those that do not watch Seinfield, hre is a brief explanation: Seinfield is a stand-up comidian that had a sit-com in the 1990s. The sitcom was a hughe sucess and it currently is - the show is avaliable on Netflix as of Feb/2022.
Vandelay Industries is a fictious company crated by Seifield's fried, George Costanza. At the time, George was unemployed and had to give proof that he was actually looking for a job to collect unemployment. The social worker asked for a company's name and he said Vandelay Industries. When pressured, he said it was an importer/exporter of latex and latex products.
